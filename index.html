                    <p class="card__title">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
                        current, if
                        not more so, in the
                        company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</p>
                    <blockquote class="card__comment">"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve
                        been
                        looking to make a transition and
                        have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course
                        and
                        found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and
                        most
                        grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers,
                        working
                        as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</blockquote>

                    <blockquote class="card__comment">"Before joining the bootcamp, I had never written a line of code.
                        I
                        needed some structure of professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. He
                        encouraged me
                        to enroll a former student of his who can only say wonderful things about the program. The
                        entire
                        curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands on and I never had to wait long
                        for help. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the
                        next
                        level in a way no tutorial ever could. In fact, I have often referred to him during interviews
                        as an
                        example of my development experience, for me he is an example to follow both personally and
                        professionally. It certainly helped me get a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
                        multiple offers. 100% recommendable!"</blockquote>
